/**
  * It is very common to have nested types like List[Option[A]],
  * or IO[Option[A]], and it is inconvenient to work with values of these
  * types directly with nested for-comprehensions or functions.
  *
  * A monad transformer combines two monads into a single monad that shares
  * the behaviour of both.
  *
  * See the example implementations for specific examples.
