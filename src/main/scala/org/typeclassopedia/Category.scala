/**
 * A Category generalizes the notion of function composition to general morphisms.
 *
 * Recall that a type parameterised by two types can be used in infix position.
 * So the ~>[_, _] below can be used like this:  A ~> B which is the same as ~>[A, B].
 * It is convenient to use the type in infix position to convey the idea of a morphism.
 *
 * Note also that Scalaz uses ⇒: rather than ~> but I thought I'd use what the TMR-Issue 13 - Typeclassopedia
 * paper used.
