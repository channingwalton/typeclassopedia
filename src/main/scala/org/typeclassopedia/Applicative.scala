/**
  * The concept of an applicative functor.
  * Brent Yorgey's description is as follows:
  * <pre>
  * Recall that Functor allows us to lift a “normal” function to a function on computational contexts.
  * But fmap [map] doesn't allow us to apply a function which is itself in a context to a value in another context.
  * Applicative gives us just such a tool. Note that every Applicative must also be a Functor.
  * </pre>
  * There is a law associated with Applicatives which states
  * <pre>
  * Give an Applicative x: X, x map g == x <*> X.pure(g)
  * </pre>
