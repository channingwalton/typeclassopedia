This project aims to be a simple implementation of the Typeclassopedia in Scala.
(If you find a simpler way to express something then please report it or send a pull request.)

Some people learn better by seeing things in code, with examples, which is why I started doing this.
The tests are intended to be examples using typical types like Option and List, but also a custom type, Blub, to show that new types can make use of the type classes defined here.

Read [The Road to the Typeclassopedia](http://channingwalton.github.io/typeclassopedia/) which I hope will be a gentle introduction to the ideas from examples rather than from theory.

How to Start
------------

I suggest you start with Functor as it is the simplest class to study, then Applicative, Monad, Semigroup and Monoid.
Then have a look at Validation which is not part of the Typeclassopedia but it's useful.

But before you do any of that, you need to understand [type classes in scala](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/motivation.html).

The tests serve as examples of use.

Exercises
---------
There is only one exercise.

1. Check out the project
1. Delete src/main/scala/org/typeclassopedia/std
1. Delete src/test/scala/org/typeclassopedia/Blub.scala (except for the case class itself)
1. Make all the tests pass again
